    <h1> Hello, I'm _iPhoenix_, and I make open-source* things. </h1>
    <p><a href="https://legend-of-iphoenix.github.io/UniChatDemo/">I made this cool thing called UniChat. You should check it out.</a></p>
    <p> I have a <a href=https://www.cemetech.net/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&u=17249>Cemetech Account</a> where I post some of my projects, and I even have a <a href="https://codewalr.us/index.php?action=profile;u=4108">Codewalrus Account</a>, even though you might not be able to see it.</p>
    <p> You can check out my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/Legend-of-iPhoenix/">here</a>, and my StackOverflow account can be viewed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/8255019/iphoenix">here</a>.</p>
    <p> I made a cool programming challenge called "Mys". I wrote an interpreter <a href="/Mys/">here</a>. 
    <p> <a href="/TheButton/">TheButton</a> is a really cool online King-of-the-Hill style game. It's really simple and intuitive, just sign in with Google and click the button!</p>

    <p> If you like my stuff enough to throw <strike>small children</strike>cryptocurrency in my general direction**, here's this arbitrary string of characters representing my Bitcoin wallet: 37fjHtHXuVhwGYuxnthUTZwZ5hwicSCKSe </p>
    <p style="font-size: 5px">* partially because I can't figure out how to make closed-source things. I rant about why I keep (almost) everything I do open-source a LOT. It might be a full half-hour every day, on average.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 5px">** maybe, in some far-off time, I'll look at my bitcoin wallet and say, "hey! I can go to the local fast-food place and buy a fifth of a kid's meal!"</p>
